In the 1960s and 1970s, the Nordend was one of the centers of the student riots in Germany, along with Hamburg and Berlin. The former German foreign minister's Joschka Fischer political career started here as a student leader for the Green Party. In the 2006 local elections, Fischer's Green Party became the biggest party in the local district assembly, called "Ortsbeirat".
      Up until today, the Nordend has a vibrant mix of artists, working-class people, students, drop-outs, gays and lesbians, and - as of recently - bankers and consultants. The students of the seventies still live here, but they are now best-agers with a high disposable income, which they spend in local wine stores and organic grocery stores. ðŸ˜‚""",
